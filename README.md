# WORK IN PROGRES!

## *Project Name:* **WebHub**

*This repository is a part of the 3-repository project*

This repository is the backend part of the project *WebHub*, whose idea is to allow multiple users control their robots seamlessly and simultaneously.

The Spring Boot server maintains websocket connections to both the human-client and the robot-client and allows the user to send commands/directives to the robot and receive feedback as well as the stream from the robot's camera.
